        <p>The common narrative is that more men are turning toward trade school. But at the same time, research from the Pew Research Center shows <a href=https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/17/women-are-a-rising-share-of-us-managers-and-professionals/#:~:text=Why%20women%20have%20made%20gains,skills%2C%20leadership%20and%20social%20perceptiveness.>women make up a growing share of high-paying occupations in the United States.</a></p>
        <p>One reason is education patterns. Most professional jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree, and<a href=https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/11/18/us-women-are-outpacing-men-in-college-completion-including-in-every-major-racial-and-ethnic-group/>women have been outpacing men in college enrollment for years—by roughly 47%</a> since 2024, according to Pew data.</p><p>Still, college is not the only path women are taking. Data from the Perkins Collaborative Resource Network shows women also earn a larger share of postsecondary career and technical education (CTE) certifications than men.</p>

        <p>These sub-baccalaureate programs—often offered at community and technical colleges—are organized into 16 career clusters. Women dominate Health Science fields and make up the majority in business-related programs, though they remain underrepresented in STEM and IT.</p>

        <p>Overall, women are participating in postsecondary education at higher rates than men, reshaping traditional gender gaps across career pathways in the U.S.</p>
